        <h3>Recipe by Paul Hollywood</h3>
        <P>There's nowhere to hide with a Margherita pizza, so you have to get every element just right. Using good-quality tinned Marzano tomatoes is key here. A good creamy buffalo mozzarella and a few basil leaves are all you need to finish it off. Simple, but absolute perfection.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quantity pizza dough, shaped into 4 balls and ready to roll out</li>
            <li>400g tin San Marzano tomatoes, drained</li>
            <li>30g Parmesan, freshly grated</li>
            <li>3 x 125g buffalo mozzarella balls, drained</li>
            <li>5A handful of basil leaves, roughly torn</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil, to drizzle</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the topping, using a blender or food processor, blitz the tinned tomatoes until smooth.</li>
            <li>If you are using a standard domestic oven to cook your pizzas, heat to its highest setting.</li>
            <li>Roll out each ball of dough to a thin round. If using a domestic oven, dry-fry the bases.</li>
            <li>Put a small ladleful of tomato pulp in the middle of each pizza base (dry-fried if cooking in a standard oven, uncooked if using a pizza oven, see below) and spread out to 2-3cm from the edge. Sprinkle with the grated Parmesan,then break off little pieces of mozzarella and scatter all over the tomatoes</li>
            <li>Bake each pizza on a tray in the hot oven for 5â€“7 minutes until the topping is melted and golden and the pizza crust is crisp. Scatter the basil over the pizzas and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Serve at once. </li>
        </ol>
