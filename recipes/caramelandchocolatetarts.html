        <h3>Recipe by Ravneet Gill</h3>
        <P>This deliciously morish tart balances sweet chocolate ganache with deeply salty miso caramel and with its no-bake base and fridge-set filling, it's a breeze to put together. Use any cereal flakes you like, but for an added nuttiness Ravneet suggests using bran.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>190g 70% dark chocolate</li>
            <li>47g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>30g roasted hazelnuts, chopped</li>
            <li>90g cereal flakes, crushed</li>                
            <li>pinch of sea salt</li>                
            <li>35g caster sugar</li>             
            <li>465ml double cream</li>                
            <li>1 tbsp white miso paste</li>
            <li>60g milk chocolate</li>               
            <li>15g icing sugar</li>                
            <li>Â½ tsp vanilla bean extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the tart cases, melt the chocolate and 40g butter in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. In a separate bowl, mix the remaining ingredients together then pour in the melted chocolate mixture. Stir until combined.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture between the six tart cases. Press into the bottom and up the sides of the cases, making sure you have a good edge to support your filling. Put into the fridge to set for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat the caster sugar in a saucepan over a medium heat to dissolve the sugar, swirling the pan from time to time, but do not stir. Once the sugar turns a deep amber, add the remaining butter and whisk well. Pour in 65ml cream and let bubble for a minute before removing from the heat and whisking in the miso.</li>
            <li>Let the caramel cool slightly in the pan, then pour into a heatproof dish. Leave to cool until it is pouring consistency, but not hot.</li>
            <li>Heat 200ml cream until it just begins to steam, but do not let it boil. Put the milk and remaining dark chocolate into a large bowl and pour over the hot cream, set aside for 1 minute. Stir with a whisk from the middle outwards, until melted and smooth. Pour into the cooled tart shells and set aside for 2 minutes.</li>
            <l1>Drizzle the caramel over the ganache, then use a cocktail stick to create a marbled effect. Put in the fridge to set.</li>
            <li>Whisk together the remaining double cream, icing sugar and vanilla bean extract until soft peaks.</li>
            <li>Remove the tarts from their cases and serve with a quenelle of Chantilly cream.</li>
        </ol>
